                Hello I'm Reid, and I'm Full Stack Software Developer. 
                I graduated Auburn in 2020 with an Applied Mathematics degree. 
                I'm 28 years old and live in Birmingham, AL. 
                In January 2022 I joined a Software Bootcamp called Innovate Birmingham, and now have nearly a year of software development experience under my belt.
                I am currently working at Icario as a Junior Software Developer.
                So far the languages I've learned are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and JSX with a React framework and Chakra UI/UX Library. 
                Prefer Linux Shell, work with agile/scrum practices, and am always, always learning.
